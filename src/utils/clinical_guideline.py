SUCCINCT DESCRIPTION OF THE OVERALL BREAST COMPOSITION (screening only)

Tissue composition patterns can be estimated more easily in the large FOVs of automated US scans but can also be discerned in the small FOV of a handheld US scan. The three
US descriptors for tissue composition described earlier in the US lexicon, “homogeneous
background echotexture-fat,” “homogeneous background echotexture-fibroglandular,”
and “heterogeneous background echotexture” (Table 3) (below) correspond loosely to
the four density descriptors of mammography and the four fibroglandular tissue descriptors of MRI. At US, breast tissue composition is determined by echogenicity. Subcutaneous fat, the tissue relative to which echogenicity is compared, is medium gray and darker
than fibroglandular tissue, which is light gray. Heterogeneous breasts show an admixture
of hypoechoic and more echogenic areas. Careful real-time scanning will help differentiate a small hypoechoic area of normal tissue from a mass.

b. Homogeneous background echotexture-fibroglandular
c. Heterogeneous background echotexture

CLEAR DESCRIPTION OF ANY IMPORTANT FINDINGS

The description of important findings should be made, in order of clinical relevance, using
lexicon terminology, and should include:

a.  Characterization of a mass using the morphological descriptors of shape, margin, and orientation. Note should be made of the lesion’s effect on the surrounding tissue, such as
    architectural distortion. Feature categories, such as posterior features and echogenicity,
    and techniques, such as color or power Doppler and elastography, may contribute information to the analysis, but only pertinent positives need to be described. Recognition of
    special case findings, such as simple and complicated cysts, clustered microcysts, intramammary lymph nodes, and foreign bodies, should simplify interpretation. In reporting
    screening examinations in asymptomatic women, as in mammography, characteristically
    benign findings may be reported (assessment category 2), but it is not obligatory, and the
    appropriate assessment would then be negative (assessment category 1).

b.  For important findings, lesion size should be given in at least two dimensions; three dimensions are preferable, especially if the volume of a mass is compared with one or
    more previous examinations. It is not necessary to report the measurements of every
    small simple cyst, and if numerous cysts are present, especially in both breasts; location
    and measurements of the largest cyst in each breast will suffice.

c.  Location of the lesion(s) should be indicated using a consistent and reproducible system,
    such as clock-face location and distance from the nipple. When more than one mass or
    abnormality is located in the same scan frame or in the same locale, measurement of the
    distance from the skin to the center of the mass or its anterior aspect may help to differentiate one lesion from another. This measurement may be particularly useful when one
    mass is singled out for biopsy and others are depicted in the field.

d.  As at mammography, multiple bilateral circumscribed masses usually are assessed as
    benign (category 2) unless one mass has different imaging features than all the others. In the unusual circumstance in which the interpreting physician chooses to describe
    multiple benign-appearing masses individually within the US report, the masses should
    be listed by breast, by location within in the breast, and by size. The reader of the report
    will be less confused, and, if surveillance is suggested as management, the performer of
    the subsequent examination will appreciate a list rather than verbose text. For bilateral
    findings, describe all the findings in each breast in a separate paragraph.

Table 4. Abnormality Hierarchy  
BI-RADS Assessment Category |     Degree of Abnormality
----------------------------|---------------------------
            1               |           Lowest

ASSESSMENT
The report should conclude with a concise summary of pertinent US findings with a final
assessment using BI-RADS® US categories 1–6 and the phrases associated with them. If report of a US examination is integrated with that of a concurrently performed mammography examination, the combined final assessment should reflect the highest likelihood of
malignancy assessed at the two examinations. Clear and consistent communication is a
goal that can be achieved for breast US by using the same assessment categories and similar wording described in the BI-RADS® Mammography section.
In some cases, the interpreting physician may render an incomplete assessment (category
0) in order to request additional examination(s), such as mammography, comparison with
previous but currently unavailable examinations, or additional physican-performed real-time
scanning after either a sonographer-produced, real-time or automated whole-breast screening US examination.

A. REPORT ORGANIZATION 

The reporting system should be concise and organized using the following structure. A statement indicating that the current examination has been compared to previous examination(s) should be included (specify date[s]). If this is not included, it should be assumed that no comparison has been made, although it is preferable to indicate that no comparison was made.

1. Indication for examination
2. Succinct description of the overall breast composition
3. Clear description of any important findings
4. Comparison to previous examination(s), if deemed appropriate by the interpreting physician
5. Assessment
6. Management

1. INDICATION FOR EXAMINATION
Provide a brief description of the indication for examination. This may be screening for an asymptomatic woman, recall of a screening-detected finding, evaluation of a clinical finding
(specify the finding and its location), or follow-up of either a probably benign lesion or cancer treated with breast conservation. 

If an implant is present, both standard and implant-displaced views should be performed, and this should be stated in the mammography report.

2. SUCCINCT DESCRIPTION OF THE OVERALL BREAST COMPOSITION

This is an overall assessment of the volume of attenuating tissues in the breast, to help indicate the relative possibility that a lesion could be obscured by normal tissue and that the sensitivity of examination thereby may be compromised by dense breast tissue. 

A few coalescent areas of dense tissue may be present in breasts with as little as 10% dense tissue, whereas primarily fatty areas may be present in breasts with as much as 90% dense tissue.

Since mammography does not depict all breast cancers, clinical breast examination is a complementary element of screening. Findings at clinical breast examination should not be ignored and may have increased importance in the dense breast.

The available data do not support the use of mammographic breast density for determining screening frequency.

The following four categories of breast composition are defined by the visually estimated content of fibroglandular-density tissue within the breasts. Please note that the categories are listed as a, b, c, and d so as not to be confused with the numbered BI-RADS® assessment categories.

If the breasts are not of apparently equal density, the denser breast should be used to categorize breast density. The sensitivity of mammography for noncalcified lesions decreases as the BI-RADS® breast density category increases. The denser the breast, the larger the lesion(s) that may be obscured. There is considerable intra- and inter-observer variation in visually estimating breast density between any two adjacent density categories. Furthermore, there is only a minimal and insignificant difference in the sensitivity of mammography between the densest breast in a lower-density category and the least dense breast in the next-higher-density category. These factors limit the clinical relevance of breast density categorization for the individual woman.

Table 5. Breast Tissue
Breast Composition Categories
a. The breasts are almost entirely fatty
b. There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density
c. The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses
d. The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography

a. The breasts are almost entirely fatty:
   Unless an area containing cancer is not included in the image field of the mammogram, mammography is highly sensitive in this setting.

b. There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density 
   (historically, there are scattered fibroglandular densities).
   It may be helpful to distinguish breasts in which there are a few scattered areas of fibroglandular-density tissue from those in which there are moderate scattered areas of fibroglandular-density tissue. Note that there has been a subtle change in the wording of this category, to conform to BI-RADS® lexicon use of the term “density” to describe the degree of x-ray attenuation of breast tissue but not to represent discrete mammographic findings.

c. The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses.
   It is not uncommon for some areas in such breasts to be relatively dense while other areas are primarily fatty. When this occurs, it may be helpful to describe the location(s) of the denser tissue in a second sentence, so that the referring clinician is aware that these are the areas in which small noncalcified lesions may be obscured. Suggested wordings for the second sentence include:“The dense tissue is located anteriorly in both breasts, and the posterior portions are mostly fatty.”“Primarily dense tissue is located in the upper outer quadrants of both breasts; scattered areas of fibroglandular tissue are present in the remainder of the breasts.”

d. The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography.
   The sensitivity of mammography is lowest in this density category.The fourth edition of BI-RADS®, unlike previous editions, indicated quartile ranges of percentage dense tissue (increments of 25% density) for each of the four density categories, with the expectation that the assignment of breast density would be distributed more evenly across categories than the historical distribution of 10% fatty, 40% scattered, 40% heterogeneously, and 10% extremely dense. However, it has since been demonstrated in
   clinical practice that there has been essentially no change in this historical distribution across density categories, despite the 2003 guidance provided in the BI-RADS® Atlas.

5. ASSESSMENT
The incorporation of an assessment category in the overall summary of the mammography report
is mandated by the Food and Drug Administration, Quality Mammography Standards; Final Rule.3
Whereas FDA-mandated assessments are not linked to management recommendations, BI-RADS®
assessment categories are designed to be concordant with specific management recommendations. The linking of assessment categories with concordant management recommendations
further enhances sound medical practice.All final assessments (BI-RADS® categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) should be based on thorough
evaluation of the mammographic features of concern or after determination that an examination is negative or benign.An incomplete (category 0) assessment is usually given for screening examinations when additional imaging evaluation is recommended before it is appropriate to render a final assessment. There may be rare situations in the screening setting in which a category 4 or 5 assessment is used, but this practice is discouraged because it may compromise some aspects of
outcome analysis.A recall (category 0) assessment should include specific suggestions for the next course of action
(spot-compression magnification views, US, etc.).

6. MANAGEMENT
If a suspicious abnormality is identified, the report should indicate that a biopsy should be performed in the absence of clinical contraindication. This is an assessment for which the interpreting physician has sufficient concern that biopsy is warranted based on imaging findings. The
recommended language (“biopsy should be performed in the absence of clinical contraindication”) provides for the unusual circumstance in which either the patient or her physician might
reasonably wish to defer a biopsy. 
Interpretation is facilitated by recognizing that most examinations may be categorized under a few
headings. These are listed in Table 6 and numeric codes are included for computer use.

# BI-RADS Ultrasound Diagnostic & Stratification Guideline

## Scope & Purpose
Standardizes description and assessment of breast findings on ultrasound (US).  
Descriptors (shape, orientation, margins, echo pattern, posterior features, associated findings) are integrated to assign a BI-RADS category communicating malignancy likelihood.  
The most suspicious (“dominant”) feature determines the category.

---

## 1. Mass: Shape
- **Oval / Round / Gently Lobulated** — favors benignity (e.g., fibroadenoma).
- **Irregular** — suspicious; upgrade to BI-RADS 4–5 depending on context.

## 2. Mass: Orientation
- **Parallel (Wider-than-tall)** — benign-leaning.
- **Not Parallel (Taller-than-wide)** — malignant-leaning; indicates tissue plane invasion.

## 3. Mass: Margins
- **Circumscribed** — benign (e.g., fibroadenoma, cyst).
- **Microlobulated / Indistinct / Angular / Spiculated** — suspicious for invasion.

## 4. Echo Pattern
- **Homogeneous Isoechoic or Hyperechoic** — benign.
- **Heterogeneous Hypoechoic** — malignant; common in invasive cancers.

## 5. Posterior Acoustic Features
- **Enhancement / None** — benign (simple cysts, some fibroadenomas).
- **Shadowing** — malignant-leaning (desmoplastic response).

## 6. Calcifications (on US)
- **Coarse / Dystrophic** — benign.
- **Fine Pleomorphic / Fine Linear or Branching (in a mass)** — malignant; upgrade recommended.

## 7. Associated Features
- **Ductal Extension / Branching, Echogenic Halo, Architectural Distortion, Skin or Nipple Retraction, Edema** — malignant-leaning; prompt BI-RADS 4–5.

## 8. Composition-Specific Entities
- **Simple Cyst:** Anechoic, thin wall, posterior enhancement, no solid part → BI-RADS 2.
- **Complicated Cyst / Clustered Microcysts:** Internal echoes but no solid vascular part → BI-RADS 3.
- **Typical Fibroadenoma:** Oval, circumscribed, parallel, homogeneous hypoechoic ± gentle lobulations → BI-RADS 3; biopsy if growth or atypical features.

| Associated Features | — | Ductal Extension, Halo, Distortion, Retraction |

---

## BI-RADS Assessment Categories (Ultrasound)

- **BI-RADS 1–2 (Negative/Benign):**
  - No abnormality or classic benign finding (e.g., simple cyst).
  - Routine screening.

- **BI-RADS 3 (Probably Benign, ≤2% risk):**
  - All features benign-leaning, no suspicious feature.
  - Examples: typical fibroadenoma, clustered microcysts, complicated cysts.
  - Management: Short-interval (6, 12, 24 mo) follow-up. Upgrade if growth/new features.

- **BI-RADS 4 (Suspicious):**
  - One or more suspicious features present.
  - Subcategorize: 4A (low suspicion), 4B (moderate), 4C (high).
  - Management: Biopsy recommended.

- **BI-RADS 5 (Highly Suggestive of Malignancy, ≥95%):**
  - Multiple high-risk features (irregular, spiculated, hypoechoic mass with shadowing ± calcifications).
  - Management: Immediate tissue diagnosis and staging.

- **BI-RADS 0 (Incomplete):**
  - Additional imaging or prior comparison required.

---

## Practical Diagnostic Rules

1. **All features benign-leaning & classic (e.g., simple cyst)** → BI-RADS 2.
2. **All benign-leaning but not diagnostic (e.g., typical fibroadenoma)** → BI-RADS 3, follow-up.
3. **Any single suspicious feature** → BI-RADS 4; biopsy indicated.
4. **Multiple high-risk features** → BI-RADS 5; treat as malignant.

---

## Common Entity Reference

- **Cysts:**
  - Simple → BI-RADS 2.
  - Complicated (low-level echoes, no solid vascularity) → BI-RADS 3.
  - Complex (solid vascular parts, thick septa) → BI-RADS 4.

- **Clustered Microcysts:** ≤3 mm, thin septa, posterior enhancement → BI-RADS 3.
- **Fibroadenoma:** Oval, circumscribed, parallel, homogeneous → BI-RADS 3 unless atypical.

---

## Implementation & Quality Audit
- Always report dominant suspicious feature.
- Use 6-month follow-up protocol for BI-RADS 3.
- Maintain PPV tracking for BI-RADS 4A/B/C categories to ensure consistent risk stratification.

# BI-RADS Mammography Diagnostic & Stratification Guideline

## Scope & Purpose
This guideline standardizes description and assessment of **regions of interest (ROIs)** on mammography.
Use **BI-RADS mammographic descriptors**—mass (shape, margin, density), calcifications (morphology, distribution),
architectural distortion, and asymmetry—then integrate the most suspicious feature into a final category.
Because this is **ROI-based**, ignore screening workflow elements (e.g., recall logistics) and focus on **local morphology**.

---

## 1. Mass (if a discrete mass is present within the ROI)

### 1.1 Shape
- **Oval / Round / Gently Lobulated** — favors benignity (e.g., fibroadenoma pattern when concordant).
- **Irregular** — malignant-leaning; upgrade category depending on margin and associated features.

### 1.2 Margins
- **Circumscribed** — benign-leaning.
- **Obscured** — limited assessment (overlap); do not downstage based on obscuration alone.
- **Microlobulated / Indistinct / Angular / Spiculated** — suspicious, with **spiculated** highest predictive value for malignancy.

### 1.3 Density (relative to fibroglandular tissue)
- **Fat-containing** (radiolucent or mixed with fat, e.g., oil cyst, hamartoma, galactocele) — strongly benign.
- **Low / Equal / High Density** (solid soft-tissue mass) — higher density trends with suspicion when combined with irregular shape or non-circumscribed margins.

**ROI note:** When margins are partially obscured, prioritize the **most confidently seen** margin segment (e.g., spiculation on any border trumps circumscribed segments).

---

## 2. Calcifications (when calcifications constitute the primary ROI finding)

### 2.1 Morphology
- **Benign-leaning patterns**:
  - Skin, Vascular, Coarse/Dystrophic, “Popcorn” (involuting fibroadenoma),
  - Large Rod-like (secretory), Milk of Calcium (teacup on lateral), Rim (eggshell), Suture.
- **Suspicious patterns** (upgrade threshold is low):
  - **Amorphous** (indistinct shapes) — low to intermediate suspicion; context-dependent.
  - **Coarse Heterogeneous** — intermediate suspicion.
  - **Fine Pleomorphic** — higher suspicion.
  - **Fine Linear / Fine Linear-Branching** — highest suspicion; consider BI-RADS 5 when distribution is ductal/segmental.

### 2.2 Distribution
- **Benign-leaning**: Diffuse/Scattered, Regional (large non-ductal area).
- **Malignant-leaning**: **Grouped/Clustered**, **Linear** (ductal course), **Segmental** (ductal–lobar system).

**ROI note:** In clustered calcifications, evaluate the **most suspicious calcification type** present in the cluster—this dictates the category.

---

## 3. Architectural Distortion (AD)
- Lines radiating from a point, focal retraction, and parenchymal distortion without a definite mass.
- **AD is suspicious**; upgrade to BI-RADS 4 unless a definite benign correlate explains the appearance (e.g., post-surgical scar with stable comparison).
- If AD coexists with suspicious calcifications or a spiculated mass, consider **BI-RADS 5**.

---

## 4. Asymmetries (ROI shows density without discrete mass)
- **Asymmetry** (single-view) / **Focal Asymmetry** (two views) / **Global Asymmetry** / **Developing Asymmetry**.
- **Developing Asymmetry** (new or increasing conspicuity) is suspicious → BI-RADS 4.
- Stable focal asymmetry with benign features and no correlates of malignancy may be considered BI-RADS 3 (short-interval follow-up), **only** if unequivocally benign-leaning and not new/increasing.

**ROI note:** For ROI assessment without priors, avoid BI-RADS 3 if **any** suspicious feature coexists (e.g., associated architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications).

---

## 5. Associated Findings (raise suspicion in any ROI)
- **Skin / Nipple Retraction** or **Thickening**, **Trabecular/Interstitial Edema**, **Axillary lymphadenopathy**, **Nipple discharge correlate** (if ductal pattern of calcifications).
- Presence of these with a suspicious ROI finding supports **BI-RADS 4–5**, depending on constellation.

---

## 6. Special Benign Diagnoses (diagnostic when classic in the ROI)
- **Oil cyst** (fat–fluid level, rim calcification), **Fat necrosis** (rim calcifications, radiolucent center), **Hamartoma** (“breast within a breast” with macroscopic fat), **Dermal calcifications** (lucent centers; skin-marker correlation).
- Classic appearances → **BI-RADS 2** (benign).

---

## 7. ROI-Centric Descriptor Summary

| Domain | Benign-Leaning | Malignant-Leaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Mass: Shape** | Oval/Round/Gently lobulated | Irregular |
| **Mass: Margin** | Circumscribed | Microlobulated, Indistinct, Angular, **Spiculated** |
| **Mass: Density** | Fat-containing | Equal/High soft-tissue density (esp. with suspicious shape/margins) |
| **Calc Morphology** | Popcorn, Vascular, Coarse/Dystrophic, Milk of Calcium, Rim | **Amorphous**, Coarse Heterogeneous, **Fine Pleomorphic**, **Fine Linear/Branching** |
| **Calc Distribution** | Diffuse/Scattered, Regional | **Grouped/Clustered**, **Linear**, **Segmental** |
| **Architecture** | — | **Architectural Distortion** |
| **Asymmetry** | Stable focal/global without other suspicious features | **Developing Asymmetry** |
| **Associated** | — | Skin/Nipple retraction, Edema/Trabecular thickening, Suspicious nodes |

---

## 8. BI-RADS Assessment Categories (ROI Mammography)

- **BI-RADS 1–2 (Negative/Benign):**
  - Negative ROI or classic benign entity (e.g., dermal/vascular calcifications, oil cyst, hamartoma).
  - Management: Routine screening per risk/age (outside ROI scope).

- **BI-RADS 3 (Probably Benign, ≤2%):**
  - ROI features are uniformly benign-leaning **without** any suspicious element.
  - Examples: Round/oval, circumscribed mass without suspicious calcifications; stable focal asymmetry with benign pattern; probably benign calcifications (e.g., milk of calcium).
  - Management: Short-interval follow-up (e.g., 6 months) when appropriate and safe.

- **BI-RADS 4 (Suspicious):**
  - **Any one** suspicious feature in the ROI: irregular mass, non-circumscribed margins (microlobulated/indistinct/angular), suspicious calcification morphology (amorphous or more worrisome), grouped/linear/segmental distribution, architectural distortion, or developing asymmetry.
  - Subcategorize: **4A/4B/4C** by gestalt risk.
  - Management: Image-guided biopsy.

- **BI-RADS 5 (Highly Suggestive of Malignancy, ≥95%):**
  - Classic malignant constellation in the ROI: **spiculated** mass ± associated suspicious calcifications; **fine linear/branching calcifications** in **segmental** (ductal) distribution; architectural distortion with malignant correlates and associated skin/nipple changes.
  - Management: Expedite tissue diagnosis and treatment planning.

- **BI-RADS 0 (Incomplete):**
  - Additional views (magnification/spot compression), tomosynthesis slices, or correlation with US/MRI required to complete ROI evaluation.

---

## 9. Practical Rules

1) **Classic benign pattern** (e.g., dermal or vascular calcifications; oil cyst; hamartoma) → **BI-RADS 2**.  
2) **All descriptors benign-leaning; no red flags** (e.g., oval, circumscribed mass without suspicious calcs) → **BI-RADS 3**; short-interval follow-up.  
3) **Any single suspicious element** (e.g., irregular or spiculated margin; amorphous/pleomorphic/linear calcifications; segmental distribution; AD; developing asymmetry) → **BI-RADS 4** (consider 4A/4B/4C).  
4) **Multiple high-risk features forming a classic malignant constellation** → **BI-RADS 5**.  
5) **Obscuration ≠ benign**: do not downstage a mass solely because margins are partially obscured; evaluate the most suspicious visible margin segment.  
6) **Calcification clusters**: category is driven by the **most suspicious morphology** present within the cluster.

---

## 10. Implementation Notes
- Document the **dominant suspicious feature** used to assign category.
- For clustered calcifications, record both **morphology** and **distribution** explicitly.
- Prefer magnification/spot compression or tomosynthesis slab review before downgrading a suspicious-leaning ROI.
- Track PPV by 4A/4B/4C to calibrate local thresholds and ensure consistent stratification.
